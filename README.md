# ScreenSaverTerminator
Personal project to go around the screen saver at my job. Using Java to move the mouse pointer every 5 minutes.


# Future updates:

Add support for dual monitors - from my understanding this will not work with them.

I am debating adding support for custom fields to include a URL that will open at a set time for scrum meetings and daily stand-ups...work smart not hard, right?
